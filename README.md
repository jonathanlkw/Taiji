Taiji board game and AI

Rules of the game can be found here: [Taiji Board Game Rules](https://www.iggamecenter.com/en/rules/taiji#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20the%20game,free%20space%20to%20do%20so.)

To run the single-player mode against the AI, run `Main.py` in the command line by navigating to the folder containing the `Main.py` and calling `python Main.py`

Main.py can also be run from any IDE with python 3.7 installed.

To run the test-runs for estimating win rates against a random opponent, replace `Main.py` in the above command with `MainAI.py`.

`MainUI.py` is currently not in use.
